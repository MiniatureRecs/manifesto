MINRECS001: Ipomea Violacea - Murrmurr 
            ‘Data murmurs. It is just a matter of directing our attention towards it’.
             With these words, Ipomea Violacea invites us to listen to her algorithmic fragments, 
             inaugurating the Miniature Recs formula.
             
             
MINRECS002: Kuhn Kuhn – Syntagma 
            Syntagma is a selection of microscopic compositions stemming from the same algorithmic blueprint. 
            ‘I’ve always been interested in working with such a constrained temporal limit’ 
            – told us Kuhn Kuhn – 
            ‘a lot of things can be expressed by slightly variating few parameters, 
            while keeping the same overall structure among the variations. 
            It is an extremely fascinating process of discovery’.
            
            
MINRECS003: Geophaga – Flashbacks 
            Geophaga's works employ algorithmic procedures with the aim of exploring and understanding human experiences through a different sonic lens.
            ‘With the Flashback sequences, I was trying to retrace back my experiences of dysphoria’. 
            The same arc made of swarms of ‘digital mosquitoes’ recur over and over through different microtonal harmonies, 
            s a persistent thought that intoxicates the senses. 
            ‘Listening to these tracks still makes me very uncomfortable, 
            yet I think they are able to depict the nauseated feeling of waking up every day and not matching your expectations, 
            seeing reality from a disjointed identity’.


MINRECS004: Edith Dahl – Fell Studies
            ‘Mark Fell has been an extremely influential artist during my formative years. 
             His conception of time disclosed many creative ideas to deal with rhythmic patterns in algorithmic music; 
             that’s why I decided to dedicate this series of snippets to him. 
             Nevertheless, I think this work also strongly reflects the aesthetic vision I developed during the pandemic period. 
             Sharpness, rugosity, and formal unevenness in clear gestalts are what thrills me most as a listener, 
             therefore they have become the prominent features of my approach to microsound’.
             
             
MINRECS005: Anneli Kokko – Eleven Clusters
            Anneli Kokko’s production revolves around noise tuning, a process she sees as a therapeutic discipline: 
            ‘Whereas most of composers conceive harmony as a sum of elements, I think that as a selection process: a purification. 
            By filtering chaos, it is possible to reach any kind of harmony. 
            My activity is to find and classify the infinite harmonic relationships that can be discovered in the depths of pure noise, 
            tracing gradients of order’.
           

MINRECS006: Riccardo Ancona – Miniata Synaxis
            Miniata Synaxis is music for an impossible liturgy, an imaginary gathering of praying monks where the tropes of polyphony have been 
            sabotaged by an exuberant xenharmonic compositional style. These twenty-six miniatures – or rather, ‘vespers’ – 
            have been written for a physical model of an organ Riccardo Ancona designed to be controlled through a live coding environment.
            ‘I am extremely delighted by the playfulness emerging from algorithmic counterpoint’ – tells us Riccardo – 
            ‘I enjoy conceiving intricate, absurd, quasi-dysfunctional canons that exceed human’s performative capability, 
            because the perceptual effect, at least for me, is a grotesque sense of amazement. 
            Polyphonic complexity is often seen as a serious matter, although it has a whimsical side that I try to disclose’.
            
           
MINRECS007: Tamura Kaori – Kaeru No Ike 
            'When I was a kid I lived near a pond full of frogs. Their croaking was the ordinary soundscape of my childhood. 
            I think my timbral and dynamical sensibility has been largely influenced by the way they modulated sound. 
            This is algorithmic frog music.' – Tamura Kaori


MINRECS008: Qiu Zhuru Chen – Scatter Engine
            Restless, abiding motion with no real change. This is the vision of reality for Qiu Zhuru Chen, 
            as well as the starting point for Scatter Engine, a record of algorithmic plunderphonics that focuses on a specific kinetic behavior,
            exploring its psycho-perceptual properties through infinite internal micro-variations.
