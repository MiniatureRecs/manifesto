MINRECS001: Ipomea Violacea - Murrmurr 
            ‘Data murmurs. It is just a matter of directing our attention towards it’.
             With these words, Ipomea Violacea invites us to listen to her algorithmic fragments, 
             inaugurating the Miniature Recs formula.
             
             
MINRECS002: Kuhn Kuhn – Syntagma 
            Syntagma is a selection of microscopic compositions stemming from the same algorithmic blueprint. 
            ‘I’ve always been interested in working with such a constrained temporal limit’ 
            – told us Kuhn Kuhn – 
            ‘a lot of things can be expressed by slightly variating few parameters, 
            while keeping the same overall structure among the variations. 
            It is an extremely fascinating process of discovery’.
            
            
MINRECS003: Geophaga – Flashbacks 
            Geophaga's works employ algorithmic procedures with the aim of exploring and understanding human experiences through a different sonic lens.
            ‘With the Flashback sequences, I was trying to retrace back my experiences of dysphoria’. 
            The same arc made of swarms of ‘digital mosquitoes’ recur over and over through different microtonal harmonies, 
            s a persistent thought that intoxicates the senses. 
            ‘Listening to these tracks still makes me very uncomfortable, 
            yet I think they are able to depict the nauseated feeling of waking up every day and not matching your expectations, 
            seeing reality from a disjointed identity’.


MINRECS004: Edith Dahl – Fell Studies
            ‘Mark Fell has been an extremely influential artist during my formative years. 
             His conception of time disclosed many creative ideas to deal with rhythmic patterns in algorithmic music; 
             that’s why I decided to dedicate this series of snippets to him. 
             Nevertheless, I think this work also strongly reflects the aesthetic vision I developed during the pandemic period. 
             Sharpness, rugosity, and formal unevenness in clear gestalts are what thrills me most as a listener, 
             therefore they have become the prominent features of my approach to microsound’.
